# OBS_Livestream_Restarter
This tool is useful if you are trying to keep a live stream going for multiple days.  The script runs every 10 sec and starts OBS with automatic live streaming if OBS is not already on (do not launch it manually before running this).  Every 11 hours and 59 minutes, it'll also shut down and restart OBS to fit under the archive limit on YouTube (and it's easier to have stream videos separated at least once a day).
